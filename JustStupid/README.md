This is just stupid.  Have a 300W led cob.  103VDC forward voltage 4.5A ish driving current.
I needed a stupidly simple power supply to see how bright a 36k lumen light is.
takes wall power, rectifies it and uses a very small ldo regulator for gate power for the 
fat mosfets.  Power resistors to limit current through COB.
